        "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Mackenzie Bell</strong> studied Fine Art at Exeter, Brighton and Central St. Martins. He taught Art in Los Angeles and Sydney and was Head of Art at St. Paul&#x2019;s College in Mid Sussex. In 1997 he left teaching to pursue a passion for painting and landscape garden design. He moved to Cornwall to create a five-acre water garden, taking Monet&#x2019;s &#x2018;Giverny&#x2019; as a source of inspiration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After four years of intensive work with his partners, Northwood Water Gardens were created, comprising nine spring fed lakes, islands, streams, bridges and waterfalls, and introducing thousands of specimen trees and shrubs. Mackenzie describes the gardens as his ever evolving, three dimensional organic painting (see website photographs).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His garden designs have featured in several publications and &#xA0;television programmes. A studio and gallery were built within the gardens and Mackenzie has progressively established himself as one of Cornwall&#x2019;s prominent painters, exhibiting in several solo and group shows.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">His work features in private collections in Europe, Canada and the U.S.A. This is his first solo show in Brighton where he now mainly lives. Works are presented within a splendid garden house, set within an enchanting walled garden.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Prices range from &#xA3;65 to &#xA3;2000, using mixed media on canvas. Cards are also available.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>&#x201D; Wonderfully sensitive work as the artist explores the linear qualities of structure and texture with audacity and maturity. Mackenzie&#x2019;s paintings are inspired as they assault our senses with astonishing vitality, energy and colour&#x201D;<br>\n</em>&#x2026;art critic, Western Morning News</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Bank Holiday weekend only:&#xA0;Sat 27, Sun 28, Mon 29th May</strong></p>",

This year look out for new designs featuring&#xA0;2000 year old Roman&#xA0;glass from Afghanistan.&#xA0;&#xA0;They offer a complete design-to-make service for any item in precious metal from engagement rings to chalices. They can also incorporate or redesign your existing jewellery in a process they call &#x2018;A Precious Legacy&#x2019;.</p>",

It ensures that your jewellery is out of your jewellery box and worn whilst maintaining the sentimental connection to past pieces. Many of the designs on display are to generate ideas for this process.</p>",
